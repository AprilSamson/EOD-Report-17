 Today was a productive day. I was able to accomplish things and I'm excited to share my progress with you. 

## Trello Fundamental Assessment Badge:
I'm happy to report that I was able to complete the Trello Fundamental Assessment Badge. It was a challenging task, but I learned a lot from it. I'm excited to take the next step and continue learning more about Trello.

## There are three core components (or building blocks) in Trello:  boards ,   lists , and  cards .
What's a board?

## A board groups information.

Most often, boards are named after a large project or a team. They are shared by everyone on the project or team, keeping all work together in one place.

## What's a list?

## Lists help organize tasks or pieces of information.

Lists are created within a board. They are used to organize information - like ideas for social media posts. Or, a list could be a step in a  workflow , such as 'Not started', 'In progress', and 'Complete'. 

Thereâ€™s no limit to the number of lists you can add to a board, and they can be arranged and titled however you like.

## What's a card?

## Cards are the smallest unit, representing tasks and ideas.

Cards are created within lists. A card can represent a task that needs to get done, like a blog post to be written. Or it can be something that needs to be remembered, like company vacation policies. 

Cards can be customized to hold a wide variety of useful information. Each card is placed in a list to show where it is. You then drag and drop cards to move them to different lists. Simply click a card to open it. You can add as many cards to a list and board as you need.

# Next Step:
Moving forward, my next step is to continue learning more about project management tools. Specifically, I plan to focus on Jira Service Management Fundamentals and the Beginner's Guide to Agile in Jira. I'm excited to take on these new challenges and apply what I learn to my work. I aim to complete these courses by tomorrow.
